        "description": "Here I graduated from a Telecommunications Engineering degree and achieved a much more complete training in the theory and concepts behind networks and their virtualization. It was here that I learned the great importance of programming for networks as a scalability and monitoring solution, since it helps us reduce the efforts that are normally made in a common network by centralizing control. Thanks to this I discovered my passion for programming and development, for the security behind computer systems, and I discovered that I have a special ability to understand complex algorithms."
